Moving objects 
Moving objects and automatic motions 

Inspiration comes from game "Fruit Ninja."
The coding process consisted of "let x," "if," "xspeed," and shape/color statements, along with the use of a "mouseX" statement to make one of the elements move with the mouse. 
The drawing itself has an abstract idea behind it: the squares and colors represent the fruits that are being cut; the black lines that are moving accross the rectangles represent the knives; the circles in the back represent the pieces of fruit being cute; and I decided to add an extra element (a basket) to collect the pieces of fruit.
